Project: `weather-monitor-NL` / Dutch Weather Intelligence

Follow the 7-Step Workflow strictly for feature implementation. Do not start implementation until Steps 1-5 are complete unless the user explicitly authorizes a different flow. Before editing, state which step you are on. Before finishing, confirm Step 6 and Step 7.

## Project Map

- Architecture: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)
- Database / Persistence: [docs/database.md](docs/database.md)
- Patterns: [docs/patterns.md](docs/patterns.md)
- Testing: [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)
- Commands: [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md)
- Agent Harness: [docs/agent-harness.md](docs/agent-harness.md)
- Full Index: [docs/index.md](docs/index.md)

## Code Graph / Repo Map

If a code graph, dependency map, or architecture index exists, use it before touching unfamiliar code.

Rules:

- Do not rebuild the graph while files are being modified.
- Only rebuild on a clean working tree.
- Use the graph as a snapshot, not a live source of truth.
- Query the graph first, then read files directly.

## 7-Step Workflow

1. **Preamble**
   - Work in a dedicated local branch or worktree.
   - Activate the project environment.
   - Confirm repo status before editing.

2. **Repo Map**
   - Run or query the available code graph/index if present.
   - Use docs and graph output to understand the relevant area.

3. **Planning**
   - Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/index.md`, and relevant technical docs.
   - Use the `brainstorming` skill for implementation planning if available.
   - Produce a concise plan and scope.
   - Do not edit until the plan is accepted unless the user explicitly granted autonomous execution.

4. **Implementation**
   - Log tasks and sub-items in `TODO.md` before editing.
   - Use the `subagent-driven-development` skill where applicable.
   - Keep edits focused.

5. **Commit**
   - Run pre-commit checks before each commit.
   - Each meaningful TODO sub-item should land as its own commit.
   - Use specific staging; never use `git add -A`.
   - Attach a git note using `.github/git_notes_template.md`.
   - Mark completed TODO sub-items with the commit hash.

6. **Pre-PR**
   - Run the `simplify` skill if available.
   - Run the `doc-updater` skill or subagent if available.
   - Invoke `test-plan-writer` if behavior, state, API, tests, or architecture changed.
   - Invoke `security-review` if the change touches auth, secrets, network calls, privileged operations, user input, money movement, broker/payment logic, or security-sensitive architecture.
   - Run full validation.

7. **Submit PR**
   - Use `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
   - Fill out summary, scope, test plan, risk, rollback, docs, backlog, and targeted UI checks.
   - Address automated review with the `receiving-code-review` skill if available.
   - Notify the user when all steps are complete.

## Workflow Rules

1. Every TODO sub-item should land as its own commit.
2. Any extension or modification to the task must be logged in `TODO.md`.
3. Use specific staging, never `git add -A`.
4. Never force-push, reset `--hard`, merge, or amend unless explicitly asked.
5. Keep comments sparse.
6. Prefer clear naming over clever abstractions.
7. Avoid compatibility shims unless explicitly required.
8. Do not leave important conclusions only in chat memory; write them to docs.

## Pre-Commit Checks

Adapt these commands to the active stack:

```bash
# Python backend
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .
pytest

# JavaScript / TypeScript frontend
npm run lint
npm test
```

If a tool is missing or unavailable, report it clearly at the end of the session.

## Pre-PR

Before submitting a PR:

- run simplification review
- update docs
- run relevant tests
- run full tests when shared state, architecture, or cross-module behavior changed
- run security review where applicable
- ensure `TODO.md` is current

## Post-PR

- `TODO.md` contains active or future work only.
- Archive completed TODO sessions into `docs/iterations/archive/`.
- Tag completed sub-items with commit hashes.
- Add session lessons to `docs/insights.md`.

## Reflection

After every completed session, record useful lessons in `docs/insights.md`:

- tools used
- scripts created
- workflow improvements
- recurring failure modes
- skills worth adding or improving
